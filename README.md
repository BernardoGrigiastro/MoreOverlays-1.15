#MoreOverlays

Adds some overlays from the 1.7.10 NEI

Added:
* Mob Spawn/Light Overlay
* Chunk Bounds
* Item Search

###Custom Build
You can make custom builds and use them.
I prefer deleting the Link to the Version File in MoreOverlays.java Line 19
```
 Original:
 public static final String UPDATE_JSON = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/feldim2425/Mod_Update-JSONs/master/MoreOverlays.json";
 
 For custom build:
 public static final String UPDATE_JSON = "";
 ```
 
 Also you have to download Mantle-1.10.2-0.10.4.jar and put it in a new Folder /libs
